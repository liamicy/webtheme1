# Liam's Web Development Project
This is my first web theme development project where i aim to produce a quality webpage theme while also improving my knowledge of CSS and HTML. In the future i plan to include javascript to make my webpage more functional but one step at a time. Please don't alter any of the basic layout for  as this is something if changed can mess the entire webpage. There are comments in the code to tell you whether you can alter the piece of code or not. Anything in the main content second can be altered apart from the placeholder text. This can be commented out if you don't want it to appear on the webpage.

Thanks,

Liam :-)
